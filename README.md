## Project Description 🚀
Welcome to our EmeriTEA online shop, where our aim is to reach as many people as possible who are willing to do their bit for the association. 
In EmeriTEA Shopping we give you the opportunity to collaborate with the association thanks to the sale of a wide variety of products made in the association, where all the benefits of their sale will go entirely to the association.

## Libraries 📚
Libraries are sets of prewritten code that are used to perform specific tasks or add functionality to an application or website. These libraries save developers time and effort as they can use existing code instead of writing it from scratch. In your project "Sound of Silence", you mentioned that you are using various technologies and tools, including libraries. Here are some of the libraries you mentioned in your project:

React: A JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces.
Bootstrap: A front-end design framework that provides ready-to-use styling and components.
Jest: A JavaScript testing framework to make sure your code works correctly.
Testing Library: A library used to write tests and perform user testing on web applications.

Each of them fulfills a specific purpose in the development of your web application. If you have additional questions about how to use these libraries or need more details about any of them, don't hesitate to ask.

## Methodology 📚

● Mob, pair and solo programming <br>
● Agile with Scrum & Trello <br>
● Testing <br>
● We work with branches: 6 working branches were used on GitHub to manage the workflow: <br>
- Main: This branch contains functional and stable code. It is the main and/or final branch. <br>
- Dev: It's the branch where different working codes are integrated into one and where preliminary testing is done before production. It's an intermediate and/or safety branch. <br>
- Independents: These are different branches where each team member develops their code according to assigned tasks for later merging into the Dev branch. It's an independent and/or testing branch. <br>
+ The branch methodology allows us to work collaboratively and maintain an organized and efficient workflow. Furthermore, working in branches allows us to work freely without conflicting with the work of other team members. Additionally, it provides us with greater control and a record or history of the various changes being made. On the other hand, for added security when merging codes from different branches, we have implemented security rules on GitHub where it is necessary to create a pull request prior to the merge.

## Tests ☑️

The Testing Library is an essential library in our 'Sound of Silence' project. This library is used to write and run tests that ensure our web application runs smoothly and meets quality standards. With Testing Library, we can simulate users' interaction with the application and verify that all components and functions respond correctly, thus providing an optimal user experience.

## Installation Process ⬆️

1. Clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/rebecapoma6/EmeriTEA-Shopping.git
2. Open the file using Visual Studio Code.
3. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
4. Install the following command: **npm i.**
5. Once the component installations are complete, in a new terminal, run **npm run dev**. Open the **localhost**: that appears.
6. In a new terminal, run the command **json-server --watch cards.json**. Open the **localhost**: that appears.
7. Now you can view not only the static Front-end web page but also add, modify, and delete the content of the cards through the Fake API.


## Next Steps 🔜
Coming soon, we will continue developing the Full Stack project with the repository https://github.com/rebecapoma6/EmeriTEA-Shopping.git The goal is to be able to work with both this Front-end repository and the Back-end repository, creating a large network of soothing sounds, reaching as many people as possible and providing an enriching and satisfying experience and helping them to unwind.
